# DNA-Analyzer
Server client application that analyzes DNA sequences to identify if a given sequence is found in a certain genome. Designed to be run on Linux. 

To compile and run the server, use the command `make` and execute the server with `./server.o`. Any test file you want to access in the program must be placed in the [test_files](./test_files) folder. 

To compile and run the client, use command `gcc client.c -o client.o` and execute the client with `./client.o`. 

For both of these, make sure you are in the root directory for everthing to work correctly.
